# DEEP_LEARNING_ON_TEXT_DATA
 
Pre-Process text based data and train a deep learning predictive model
The goal of this project is to implement a text processing pipeline including tokenization, and encoding in order to allow the fitting of a sequential neural network model with and without embedding, a LSTM model and a 1D convent model.  The goal is to measure the performance of such a models on text data.
